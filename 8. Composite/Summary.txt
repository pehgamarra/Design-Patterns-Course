- Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition

- some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors

- Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly

- Python supports iteration with __iter__ the IterableABC

- A single object can make itself iterable by yelding self from __iter__
